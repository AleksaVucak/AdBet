# AdBet
AdBet Casino is a first-of-its-kind platform that eliminates financial risk for players. Instead of depositing real money, users earn credits exclusively by watching targeted ads. Once a certain threshold is reached, these credits can be withdrawn, making for a truly no-risk gambling experience. This model not only creates a more accessible platform for players but also provides advertisers with valuable, engaged viewership. Through AdBet Casino, everyone benefits - players enjoy exciting gameplay at zero cost, while advertisers reach a highly receptive audience.
> This project is still a work in progress.. my goal is to deploy while trying to balance applications, interview prep, and course work and hopefully have an industry disrupting startup.

## Features
With a selection of popular games, including Blackjack, Slot Machines, and a Crash-inspired game, AdBet Casino caters to a diverse range of player preferences. The withdrawal system ensures that users can enjoy their winnings once they accumulate enough credits, adding an exciting layer of motivation. The interface is designed with accessibility and ease of use in mind, ensuring a seamless experience for all users.

### Game Details
Blackjack
- The Blackjack game follows classic rules, pitting the player against the dealer in a strategic battle to reach 21 without exceeding it. With intuitive controls and clear instructions, even beginners can enjoy the challenge.

Slot Machines
- The slot machine game offers dynamic payouts and exciting visuals. Players can spin the reels and aim for high-value combinations to maximize their winnings.
  
Crash
- This game draws inspiration from the popular Crash game format. Players place their bets and attempt to cash out before the multiplier crashes, combining strategy and quick decision-making.

Mines
- Players start with a grid containing hidden mines and safe spots. The objective is to uncover as many safe spots as possible without triggering a mine. With each successful uncovering, the payout increases, but so does the risk. Players can choose to cash out at any time or continue uncovering tiles for higher rewards.

## Tech Stack
The platform is powered by a robust technology stack that ensures scalability, performance, and security. The frontend is developed using React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface. On the backend, Node.js and Express.js handle server-side operations, ensuring fast and reliable performance. MongoDB serves as the database, efficiently managing user data and game states.
> Authentication is currently a work in progress but I plan on managing it through Firebase Auth, providing a secure login functionality. The platform is planned to be hosted on a reliable service (AWS). Additionally, APIs are going to be integrated to display ads and track credit earnings, creating a smooth connection between ad engagement and gameplay.
